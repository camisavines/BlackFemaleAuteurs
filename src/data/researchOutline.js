    The intersectionality of black women makes them the most disrespected and unprotected persons in America. 
    In the film industry, there are also the most unsupported. 
    New research reveals the barriers that Black women in the TV and film industry face, including the lack of financial support 
    from major Hollywood studios, the opposition to expose the sociopolitical systems of racism, patriarchy, and homophobia, and 
    the opposition to allow black women to explore the textures of Black women’s lives independent of these systems. 
    However, in the past few years, we’ve seen a ground-breaking renaissance of black female film, where such auteurs are reshaping and 
    defining black identity and culture by resisting cultural hegemony and creating a more inclusive and representative media. 
    By these works, it is affirmed that the images, messages, and artistry created by black female auteurs are the tools 
    to dismantle hegemonic power and bring forth mental liberation.

    If black women were given the same platforms, resources, and financial support 
    as men to persuade the media, they could single-handedly revolutionize 
    [everything we know].
