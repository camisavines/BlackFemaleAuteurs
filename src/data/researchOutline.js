    This site represents the research I conducted during my time in the F375. 
    It is an annotated bibliography that works to examine acts of resistance made by black women throughout the history 
    of the film industry by highlighting a few key, outstanding films by black female auteurs. 
    Each film is analyzed in its relation to its auteur and its connection to some of the issues that black women are facing 
    today while also celebrating the artistic approach and its disruptive and revolutionary nature.

    If black women were given the same platform, opportunity, and financial support
    to persuade the media as men, they would completely disrupt 
    [everything we know about our social hierarchy, power dynamics, â€¦, every racial ingrained fiber within all of us ]
