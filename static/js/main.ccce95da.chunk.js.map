It is the purest form and most glaring example in American History to me, of resistance. The structure of slavery was such that love, as well as many other ideologies, would not develop. Families were separated several times over, mothers and fathers were killed, men, women, and children raped. Marriage was forbidden among blacks unless sponsored by a white person, and even then, that was only in certain states.\n                            </p>\n                            <p>\n                            White supremacy tried to kill the notion of black love, because it was a threat to oppression.

Familial, heterosexual, trans, queer, community, etc. Everything was done to prevent it. It is the purest form and most glaring example in American History to me, of resistance. The structure of slavery was such that love, as well as many other ideologies, would not develop. Families were separated several times over, mothers and fathers were killed, men, women, and children raped. Marriage was forbidden among blacks unless sponsored by a white person, and even then, that was only in certain states.\n                            </p>\n                            <p>\n                            White supremacy tried to kill the notion of black love, because it was a threat to oppression. White supremacy did its best to make “black love” an oxymoron. A figment of our imagination. For many, it still is.\n                            </p>\n                        </blockquote>\n                        <figcaption className=\"blockquote-footer mb-0\">Reginald Cunningham, Contributor, Writer.

It is in this chapter that the audience understands that true liberation comes from within. Somehow, against all odds, black people have managed to survive. In the clip, the black-and-white switches abruptly to color, which, at this point in the film, we see a shift in imagery from what feels slow and careful to vibrant freedom. We see women gathering, working, planting and harvesting.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n\n            {/* FORMATION */}\n            <div className='row my-5 py-5' style={{fontSize: \"12pt\", lineHeight:\"3rem\"}}>\n                <div className='col-12'>\n                    <h2 style={{fontWeight: \"900\"}}>FORMATION</h2>\n\n                    <div className=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n                        <iframe className=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDZJPJV__bQ\" title=\"FORMATION\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <div className='col-lg-8 my-5'>\n                    <p>\n                        Featured director of “Formation” Melina Matsoukas states that Beyoncé explained the concepted to her stating that she wanted to “She wanted to show the historical impact of slavery on black love, and what it has done to the black family, and black men and women—how we're almost socialized not to be together”. \n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default BeyonceLemonade;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Daughters_of.d700d950.jpeg\";","import React from \"react\";\n\nimport SholaLynch from \"../components/research/SholaLynch\";\nimport StellaMeghie from \"../components/research/StellaMeghie\";\nimport MelinaMatsoukas from \"../components/research/MelinaMatsoukas\";\nimport BeyonceLemonade from \"../components/research/BeyonceLemonade\";\n\n\nimport Tooltip from \"../components/textTooltip\";\nimport hero from \"../images/Daughters_of.jpeg\";\nimport \"../styles/home.css\";\nimport \"../styles/timeline.css\";\n\nconst Home = () => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <section className=\"home hero\">\n                <div className=\"container\">\n                    <h1>Resistance of Hegemony: Mental Liberation during the Renaissance of Black Female Auteurs</h1>\n                    <p>Camisa Vines <br/> <small className=\"text-muted\">December 14, 2021</small></p>\n\n                    <figure className=\"figure my-3\">\n                        <img src={hero} className=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Julie Dash 1991\"/>\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-right\"><em>Daughters of the Dust (1991)</em> by Julie Dash</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n\n                    <div className=\"row py-5\" style={{fontSize: \"12pt\", lineHeight:\"3rem\"}}>\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-8\">\n                            <p>\n                                <span className=\"first-letter\">T</span>he \n                                <Tooltip label=\"intersectionality\" text={`\n                                    <p>\n                                        the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, \n                                        and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping \n                                        and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage.\n                                    </p>`\n                                } /> \n                                of black women makes them the most disrespected and unprotected persons in America. \n                                In the film industry, there are also the most unsupported. \n                                New research reveals the barriers that Black women in the TV and film industry face, \n                                including the lack of financial support from major Hollywood studios, the opposition to expose \n                                the sociopolitical systems of racism, patriarchy, and homophobia, and the opposition to allow black \n                                women to explore the textures of Black women’s lives independent of these systems. \n                                However, in the past few years, we’ve seen a ground-breaking renaissance of black female film, \n                                where such auteurs are reshaping and defining black identity and culture by resisting \n                                <Tooltip label=\" cultural hegemony \" text={`\n                                    <p>\n                                        In Marxist philosophy, cultural hegemony is the dominance of a culturally diverse society \n                                        by the ruling class who manipulate the culture of that society—the beliefs and explanations, \n                                        perceptions, values, and mores—so that the worldview of the ruling class becomes the accepted cultural norm.\n                                    </p>\n                                `}/>\n                                and creating a more inclusive and representative media.

<p>In recent years, #OscarsSoWhite has highlighted Hollywood’s lack of racial inclusivity, and the #MeToo movement has underscored the pervasiveness of sexual assault in the entertainment industry. Amidst these longstanding realities, however, Black women filmmakers have been bringing their confident and perceptive visions to the cinematic screen. Throughout the twentieth century, the Hollywood studio system emerged and evolved as a dominant force in world cinema. With increasing output in the late twentieth century, Black female auteurs managed to finance, shoot, and release their work independent of these big studios. Moreover, in recent decades, Black women filmmakers have found ways to thrive alongside the big picture system despite its culture of exclusion.</p>\n                            <p>This course is a focused study of Black female auteurs in the United States. As a class, we will contemplate both the concept of the auteur in film history as well as the constraints of that approach to filmmaking. We will also examine how Black women filmmakers negotiate these challenges, and we will sample the range of expressive practices in Black women’s cinema.
